# Brain Tumor Detection System (AI Powered)

This is a Deep Learning project that detects Brain Tumors from MRI images using a CNN model and Streamlit interface.

## Project Structure
- `app.py` : Streamlit application for tumor detection
- `train_model.py` : Code to train the CNN model
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies
- `brain_tumor_model.h5` : Trained model (Download from Google Drive)

## Model Download
Download the trained model from Google Drive:

[Download brain_tumor_model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B9vbxl1vg0bFhVA_5SReq9J_aocJ46BA/view?usp=sharing)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run Streamlit app:
4. Upload a Brain MRI image and detect tumor.

## Dataset
- Dataset contains MRI images with Tumor (Yes) and No Tumor (No)
- You can download from Kaggle: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
